# Ravenous

This is a Codecademy project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and to which I'm adding new features.

## API

The app utilises the [Yelp Fusion REST API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3).

## Project status & Roadmap

The design and main search functionality of this app was laid out by Codecademy in a guided project. Its purpose is to get a better hands-on understanding of React and REST API's, no more and no less. It's currently in development for extra features of my own.

### Current features:
- User can click the business' image to open the business' Yelp page
- User can click the business' address to open its location in Google Maps (using the Maps API)
- User can submit the search by pressing Enter as opossed to just clicking "Let's Go"

### Features in progress:

- User can select an autocomplete suggestion when typing a category or keyword
- User can select an autocomplete suggestion when typing a business name

### Upcoming features:

- User can load results by clicking on a different sorting option (rather than having to manually click "Let's Go")
- User can search businesses by price range
